# SummerSchool2025-IntroBayes
*Introduction to Bayesian data analysis* lecture slides and supplementary content for the Penn State University Center for Astrostatistics (CASt) [20th Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers | Center for Astrostatistics](https://sites.psu.edu/astrostatistics/su25/),  June 2025

In addition to the slides and supplementary content, this repo contains a recent tutorial article by instructor Tom Loredo and Duke University statistician Robert Wolpert. The ADS entry for the tutorial is:

* [Bayesian inference: more than Bayes's theorem - Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024FrASS..1126926L/abstract) (Loredo & Wolpert 2024)

Also included is a brief, nontechnical note (unpublished) on the AIC, BIC, and DIC model selection criteria:

* [Understanding information criteria for model selection](./Loredo2010-UnderstandingInfoCriteria.pdf) (Loredo 2010)

Additionally, there is a tutorial note on handling correlated noise in time series modeling via *generalized least squares*, using an AR(1) hidden Markov model; it also briefly describes how to handle correlated noise in nonparametric bootstrap analysis of time series data:

* [Notes on correlated noise and dependent data resampling](./Loredo2015-CorrelatedNoise-GenLeastSquaresNotes) (Loredo 2015)
